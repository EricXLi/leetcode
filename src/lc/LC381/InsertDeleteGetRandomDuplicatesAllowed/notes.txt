To remove item fast from arrayList:
	int endIndex;
	set(toBeRemovedIndex, itemAtLastIndex);
Keep track of an index yourself can help the performance...

Accept at count/total probability does not actually work
If there's three elements, each showed up once, two of them have the probability of 1/3 and one of them will have 4/9


You can't use primitive types as generic arguments in Java.
HashMap only accepts Integer not int, but when you do put/remove, autoboxing will kick in and take care of the overhead.
